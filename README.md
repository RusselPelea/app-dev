# My favorite series 

My current favorite series of anime would be ==Eminence in Shadow==.
The story is a parody and deconstruction of typical isekai and fantasy tropes, blending action, comedy, and absurdity.

The story is about a kid who dreams to be the ==mastermind in the shadows== controlling everything behind the scenes setting up absurd events
not to be the hero but to just feel the joy of being the shadowy figue that controls everything while leaving only faint traces behind.

The anime balances dark fantasy themes, epic battles, and Cid's over-the-top delusions, delivering a unique mix of satire and engaging storytelling.
it is currently in its 2nd season with more seasons coming.

[10/10 in my book] :thumbsup:
